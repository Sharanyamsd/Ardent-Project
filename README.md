❤️ Heart Disease Prediction
A simple machine learning web app to predict the risk of heart disease. Built using the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Streamlit.

📌 About
Goal: Predict heart disease risk using basic medical data.

Dataset: Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset (303 records).

Algorithms: Logistic Regression & KNN.

App: User inputs health data → model predicts risk → shows result & advice.

🧩 Main Features
Cleaned and pre-processed medical data.

EDA with correlation heatmap.

Accuracy ~85% (Logistic Regression).

Deployed as an easy-to-use Streamlit app.

📊 Limitations
Not a medical diagnosis — just a risk estimate.

Small dataset — real accuracy may vary.

Does not include real-time data.

🔮 Future Work
Add larger datasets.

Use advanced models.

Build mobile version.

Connect to wearables.
